There are so many web demos for machine learning tasks

Are you prototyping some weird idea? need to try out several models in your pipeline?

Don't have the hardware to run some crucial component?

This repo using requests to hit several endpoints for a lot of web apis, try something new in your pipeline before investing time on your own implementation and setup!

Please do not abuse this, it is meant for quick prototyping and experimentation only! 

Have a suggestion for another web demo? open an issue
